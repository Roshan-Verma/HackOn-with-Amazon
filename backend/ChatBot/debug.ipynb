(ii) Manual repayment function from Amazon Pay Later dashboard for manual repayment of the installments or full outstanding balance through debit card, UPI or net-banking of any bank.\\n\\nFor setting up auto repayment, you are redirected to your bank page where you can complete it by Net banking or debit card-based authentication. Once this is set, the due amount will be automatically deducted from your linked bank account/debit card, thus making repayments hassle-free.\\n\\nYour bank might charge one-time mandate setup charge. Please read details on your bank page carefully.\\n\\nNote: Repayment of pay later credit dues is not allowed with another credit(Credit Card or Loans)\\nRupay credit cards are not supported for auto repayment setup.\\n\\nWill I get any reminder notification for EMI payments?\\nYes, you will be notified about upcoming payments via SMS and/or Email, 3-4 days before the due date so that you can keep the bank account well-funded for the repayments.\\n\\nDo I have to make multiple payments if I have placed more than one orders using Amazon Pay Later?\\nWe will club monthly installments across all your purchases made using Amazon Pay Later into one total EMI amount.\\n\\nWhen is my Amazon Pay Later repayment due?\\nFor axio customers, purchases made using Amazon Pay Later between 1st and end of the month will have the due amount calculated on the 1st day of the subsequent calendar month and will be payable by the 5th day of the same calendar month.\\n\\nFor example: If your lending partner is axio and you\\'ve made a transaction using Amazon Pay Later between June 1st to June 30th, your due amount will be calculated on 1st of July and the due date / first EMI date will be on 5th of July.\\n\\nFor IDFC customers, purchases made between 1st and 15th of the month will have a due date / first EMI date on the 5th day of the next month and for any purchase between 16th and till the end of the month, the due date / first EMI date will be the 5th day of the month next to the subsequent one.\\n\\nFor example: If your lending partner is IDFC and you\\'ve made a transaction using Amazon Pay Later on June 14th , the first EMI will be due on 5th of July. And, if you\\'ve made a transaction using Amazon Pay Later on June 18th, the first EMI will be due on 5th of August (month next to the subsequent one).\\n\\nWill I incur any late payment fees/penalties for delayed payments?\\nIf you miss your payments on due date, we request you to manually pay it as soon as possible. Lender may charge a late fee if dues are not repaid by due date (5th of the next calendar month). Please refer to the Key Fact Statement prior to transaction or Sanction Letter post transaction for exact details on late fee charges applicable on your loan.\\n\\nLate Payment Fee for IDFC: 3% of unpaid due amount + GST of 18% on late fee.\\n\\nThis will be levied on 11th of the month, while due date is 5th of the month.\\n\\nBelow is an illustrative table of Late Payment Fee for Axio:\\n\\nThis will be levied on 7th of the month, while due date is 5th of the month.\\n\\nMonthly due amount (INR)\\tLate payment fee (INR)\\n<= Rs 200\\t0\\n>200 <= Rs 1,000\\t125\\n>1,000 but <=5,000\\t250\\n>5,000 but <=20,000\\t425\\n>Rs 20,000\\t600\\nWhy is axio / IDFC FIRST Bank being shown in my bank statement or during auto-repayment setup?\\nWe have partnered with axio / IDFC FIRST Bank to provide Amazon Pay Later facility. The monthly installment payments due/paid for your purchases using Amazon Pay Later limit are credited to the account of axio / IDFC FIRST Bank.\\n\\nWhat happens in case my auto-repayment setup fails while making first purchase using limit of Amazon Pay Later?\\nYour purchase transaction will be declined. You will have to retry the payment from \"Your Orders\" page for that order.\\n\\nCan I repay my partial outstanding amount?\\nYes, you can pay upcoming due & total outstanding amount using the Amazon Pay Later dashboard without any additional charges.\\n\\nWhat happens if my debit card/bank doesn\\'t have sufficient funds at the time of auto-deduction of funds towards EMI repayments?\\nIn such a case, we will notify you through email and/or SMS about repayment rejection from bank and details on how to manually complete the payment to avoid any late payment fees/penalties that our lending partner may impose.\\n\\nPlease note that your Amazon Pay Later account can be blocked after few days post the due date if the installment payment is not received and will only be unblocked once the due payments are complete.\\n\\nCan I change the auto repayment settings after registering for Amazon Pay Later?\\nYes, you can update your bank account for auto-repayment setup from Amazon Pay Later Dashboard.\\n\\nCan I change my repayment date?\\nNo, repayment dates cannot be changed. Please contact your lender for more details.\\n\\nWhat happens if I don\\'t pay my EMI on time?\\nIt is very important to pay your EMI on time in order to avoid late payment charges, maintain a good credit rating, to prevent suspension of Amazon Pay Later facility, further actions on your Amazon account and avoid any legal action.\\n\\nPlease maintain adequate balance in your account around the repayment date. Not paying your EMI on time could result in a negative impact to your CIBIL score and all other bureau scores.\\n\\nWhat should I do in case wrong amount got deducted from my bank or money got debited even after I\\'ve made a manual payment?\\nIn all such cases, the excess funds deducted will be credited back to the respective bank account from \\'axio / IDFC FIRST Bank (our lending partner)\\' in 5 business days.\\n\\nWhat is cooling off period mentioned in the Key Fact Statement (KFS)?\\nA borrower shall be given an explicit option to exit digital loan by paying the principal and the proportionate Annual Percentage Rate (APR) i.e., effective interest rate of loan without any penalty during this period. The cooling off period shall be determined by the Board of the Regulated Entity i.e. your lender. For borrowers continuing with the loan even after cooling off period, pre-payment shall continue to be allowed as per extant RBI guidelines. Please refer to the Key Fact Statement prior to transaction or Sanction Letter post transaction for the applicable Cooling off period for your loan.\\n\\nWhen I return an order purchased using Amazon Pay Later, what amount will be refunded?\\nIf the Amazon Pay cashback is already credited to your account, on returning the item, the amount of refund processed will be the Total Order Value minus the Cashback Value added in your account. This essentially means that you received the refund in two parts (i) Cashback value in Amazon Pay Balance: Gift Cards (ii) and remaining value as deduction in utilized limit of Amazon Pay Later\\n\\nIn this case, since full amount is not refunded from your Amazon Pay Later limit, the differential value (which is the value of your cashback) is still utilized from your Amazon Pay Later, for which you have to pay EMI payments. We will convert this remaining value in the EMI plan of same tenure (as that of your order). EMIs will definitely be lower as total amount to be paid is lesser.\\n\\nThis new EMI plan (pertaining to cashback value) will be reflected in your Amazon Pay Later Dashboard in \"Total Outstanding Amount payable\" & \"Utilized Limit\".\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nTotal Order Value (T)\\tRs.10000\\nAmazon Pay Later limit utilized\\tRs.10000\\nOriginal EMI Tenure selected\\t6 months\\nCashback value (C)\\tRs.1000\\nRefund value (T-C)\\tRs.9000\\nTotal Order Value (T)\\tRs.10000\\nAmazon Pay Later limit utilized\\tRs.10000\\nOriginal EMI Tenure selected\\t6 months\\nCashback value (C)\\tRs.1000\\nRefund value (T-C)\\tRs.9000\\nHere, Rs.1000, i.e. the cashback amount deducted from your refund will be converted into an EMI plan for 6 months tenure in your account.\\n\\nImportant Notes:\\n\\nIf you\\'ve placed only one order using Amazon Pay Later and had to return it, you can pre-pay the total value of cashback plus accrued interest from Amazon Pay Later dashboard-> Make Payment-> Pay Total outstanding.\\nIf you\\'ve placed more than one orders using Amazon Pay Later and returned one of them on which you got cashback, you will not be able to pre-pay only the total value of cashback plus accrued interest. If you want, you can pay the total outstanding value of all orders plus cashback plus accrued interest from Amazon Pay Later dashboard-> Make Payment-> Pay Total outstanding.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan I cancel the order placed using Amazon Pay Later?\\nYes. Just like any other order on Amazon, you can cancel or request cancellation any time before the delivery of the order.\\n\\nDo you charge any cancellation/return fee for Amazon Pay Later?\\nNo. There is no Amazon Pay Later specific cancellation fee in case you return or cancel the order purchased using Amazon Pay Later.\\n\\nHow can I revoke the consent given for use of my data for my Amazon Pay Later account?\\nRevoking consent given for use of your data will result in the closure of your Amazon Pay Later account. Only if there are no outstanding dues, we will be able to process account closure requests. If all the dues are clear, please call our customer service team or reach out to our lending partner\\'s customer service to request account closure.\\n\\n\\n1.
